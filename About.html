		<li>Git usage
			<ol>
				<li>We believed using the method where "One person owns the repository, others are collaborators" would be the best choice for this project</li>
				<li>Outside of the practical we all used the GitHub Desktop client to manage our work, with regular commits alongside pushes to the origin ensuring other group members didn't run into issues</li>
			</ol>
		</li>
		<li>We briefly planned the layout of the website using a collaborative google sheet</li>
		<li>Bootstrap was used to create a consistent and hopefully aesthetically pleasing design</li>
		<li>As the only CS student in the group Temi carried us pretty hard but Tom & I also tried</li>
