A review of the Programming Formative by Steve Thomas (steve.thomas@durham.ac.uk)

<ol>
<li> <b>Interest of Content</b></li>
<p> Overall, the content looks interesting and the use of images make the content better to look at.
<br> I would give it a <b> very good </b> for this category </p>

<li> <b>Consistency and quality of visual presentation</b></li>
<p> The header is consistent throughout the webpages which is nice but the text doesn't seem to follow a consistent theme.
<br> I would give it a <b> good </b> for this category </p>

<li> <b>Quality of written presentation</b></li>
<p> The text has been structured by using p tags. However, that is all that has been used. It could do with lists etc. 
<br> I would give it a <b> acceptable</b> for this category </p>

<li> <b>Validity of HTML</b></li>
<p> The HTML looks structured and has been indented correctly making it readable. All tags have been closed and overall looks very valid.
<br> I would give it a <b> excellent </b> for this category </p>

<li> <b>Evidence of Collaboration</b></li>
<p> Author information doesn't appear to be written seperately but there appears to be a balanced contribution from all members and it wasn't all completed last minute. 
<br> I would give it a <b> very good </b> for this category </p>
</ol>
