    <h1>The Internet</h1>
    <p>The internet is a global network of computers. The internet dates back to ARPAnet, which was created by the US
	Defence Department’s Advanced Research Projects Agency in the '60s. At the end of 1969, just four computers
	existed on ARPAnet, all at US universities. This soon grew to 5,000 internet hosts by 1986, after which the number
	of users grew quickly into hundreds of millions.</p>
	<p>The main factors behind this increase were the opening of an academic and government network to the public,
	and its rapid spread across the world from the US. Another reason was the huge growth of the personal computer market 
	in the 1980s, the invention of the World Wide Web by Tim Berners-Lee in the early 1990s, and the widespread adoption
	of broadband in the 2000s. Web browsers have made the internet easy enough for anyone to use.  With relatively cheap 
	personal computers and the benefits of broadband, more than a billion people are using it. Now that internet access
	is becoming popular on mobile phones, the next billion users should be online fairly soon.</p>
	<h2>Why is it so important?</h2>
	    <ul>
	      <li>It is the world's greatest source of information</li>
          <li>It allows people to connect from opposite ends of the Earth</li>
          <li>It is widely accessible to billions of people</li>
        </ul>
